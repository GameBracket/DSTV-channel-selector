# DSTV-channel-selector
This is a file that allows you to type in a channel and its loads it up on the dstv now website.
Note:
- you have to have a DStv account for this     to work
- this was made with vbs meaning it only works on windows
- when it loads up the link you still have to select the profile you want to use (I'm still working on this loading up a default profile)
- I'm still adding a lot of other channels, as the only channels that you type that work are 161, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305

Dev notes:
- I will make this into a JavaScript project that you will have to install, once I have access to JavaScript (currently don't have a laptop)
- About the above note, you will still be able to use the vbs version but I might not keep updating the vbs version once the JavaScript version comes out
- it might take a while for me to add the other channels
- please feel free to use my project for any commercial use, but please give me credit
- you are free to push updates to the project but please use the same code syntax as the code that is already there and please don't expect me to accept your push
- please feel free to message me on discord if  you have any suggestions
